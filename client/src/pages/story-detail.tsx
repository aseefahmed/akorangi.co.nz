I've built the backend (database schema, storage methods, API routes) and created 5 engaging New Zealand-themed stories with 3 chapters each. I've also started on the frontend components (StoryCard and Stories page).\n\nTo complete the feature, I still need to:\n1. Create the story detail page (where users see chapter narrative and complete practice questions)\n2. Add navigation to the Stories page in the header\n3. Integrate story mode with the existing practice system\n4. Test everything end-to-end\n\nWould you like me to continue and complete the Story/Adventure Mode implementation?", "confirm_text": "Yes, complete it!", "reject_text": "No, pause here"}]
